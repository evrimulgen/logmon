# logmon

A simple console program that monitors HTTP traffic on your machine.

## Setup & Usage

1/ Install go

2/ Run ```go get github.com/gabsn/logmon```

3/ Use it to monitor your log files:
```bash
logmon [logPath] [threshold]
```
4/ You can go to the loggen directory and type ```make run``` to generate a log.txt file

## Configuration

You can edit your preferences concerning the period of refreshment in the config/global.go file.

## Testing

You can run ```go test``` in the models directory to test the Alert logic

## Project Architecture

I used two goroutines to manage the two main concurent tasks:

1/ The first one represented by the __feeder package__ is to consume the log file, parse it into a Hit struct and sending it to the circular buffer.

2/ The second one represented by the __controller package__ is to monitor and alert the user if the number of hits becomes greater than the threshold.

Finally, I used a __circular buffer__ to store information about hits. Since the two goroutines are concurrently talking to the circular buffer I used a mutex to protect it against race conditions.

## Why go ?

The programming languages I enjoy coding with at the moment are Go, Python and C++.

Though I love Python for one-shot apps, it does not have built-in concurrency and has rather poor performances in comparison with Go and C++.

Concerning C++, I wanted to avoid having to deal with POSIX threads and memory management...

That's why I chose go: for its lightweight easy-to-use goroutines, its efficient garbage collector and also because at the moment I really enjoy working with it.
